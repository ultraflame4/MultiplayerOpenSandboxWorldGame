### What is this crap?

Well, its just a project. 

### How do i play it?. 

There isn't a really "proper" way to install and run it just yet.

### Instructions:

#### To Play:
run `client_main.py` in the `mog` folder

#### To Host:
1. Goto `__main__.py` and open it in a text editor
2. Find `server="localhost"`, change `localhost` to your desired ip or hostname
3.run `__main__.py` in `mog/server` folder
